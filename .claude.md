## Notes for Claude

### When Working on This Project

**Do:**
✅ Reference the design system tokens for any new components
✅ Maintain consistency with chosen design direction
✅ Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG AA minimum)
✅ Use 8pt spacing grid for all spacing decisions
✅ Preserve brand messaging from the brief
✅ Consider the target audience for each design

**Don't:**
❌ Mix design systems (each is distinct and complete)
❌ Create new color variations without justification
❌ Ignore responsive breakpoints
❌ Add decorative elements that don't serve function
❌ Compromise accessibility for aesthetics
❌ Deviate from brand messaging

### Understanding the Designs

- **Design 1:** Warmth + trust = healthcare professionals
- **Design 2:** Tech + minimal = innovation-focused buyers
- **Design 3:** Earth tones + premium = upscale wellness
- **Design 4:** Monochrome + bold = design-conscious market

Each design is complete and production-ready. They can be mixed/matched at component level, but work best as cohesive systems.
