## **Section 1: The Origin Story**

For over 25 years, Drew Freedman built his career around a single mission — to help people feel better. As the founder of The Boston Bodyworker, his work was hands-on, relational, and deeply rooted in purpose. Each session reflected not only skill but compassion — a belief that true healing comes from connection. When it came time to close the practice, it marked the end of a defining chapter and the beginning of a new one.

Transitions like this rarely arrive with clarity. They bring reflection — questions about identity, direction, and legacy. During that time of pause, Drew bought a stand-up paddleboard. It was meant to bring balance — physically and mentally. But as he inflated it one quiet afternoon, something extraordinary happened. The strength, structure, and feel beneath his hands echoed the support he had depended on throughout his entire career. The realization struck like a clap of thunder — this material could redefine the therapy table. Not just another version of what already existed, but something fundamentally better.

In that moment, Sidekick Air was born — not as a product, but as a continuation of purpose. A way to honor the professionals who dedicate their lives to helping others heal, and to give them tools that finally return the favor.

## **Section 2: The Problem to Solve**

For decades, therapy tables have remained unchanged — heavy frames, fixed dimensions, and outdated construction. While therapists have evolved their techniques, their tools have not kept pace. The work of healing demands presence, skill, and care, but the tools have demanded something entirely different: endurance and compromise.

Every day, therapists across massage, athletic training, and rehabilitation fields face the same frustrations:

• Excessive weight — traditional tables often exceed 35–45 pounds, creating daily physical strain just to move them.

• Awkward balance — carrying a table through tight spaces, stairs, and vehicles feels like wrestling with an anchor.

• Bulky storage — tables consume valuable space in homes, clinics, and vehicles.

• Setup fatigue — complex assembly wastes energy before a single client session begins.

• Durability trade-offs — lighter tables sacrifice strength, causing instability during treatment.

• Freight limitations — oversized dimensions drive up shipping costs and limit outreach opportunities.

• Lack of branding — few options exist for customization or professional visibility.

• Environmental impact — conventional materials and shipping processes increase waste and carbon footprint.

These are not minor inconveniences — they are obstacles that silently wear down even the most passionate professionals. Sidekick Air checks every box. Built from advanced drop-stitch material used in aerospace and marine engineering, it offers exceptional strength without the burden. It inflates to a rock-solid 6-inch surface capable of supporting over 800 pounds, yet packs down to the size of a yoga mat. It’s easy to carry, effortless to store, and eliminates the hidden strain that has held the industry back for decades. It’s not just innovation — it’s liberation for the modern therapist.

## **Section 3: The Sidekick Air Difference**

Sidekick Air redefines what a therapy table can be — powerful, portable, and purpose-built for today’s evolving landscape. It inflates in minutes, travels effortlessly, and adapts to any environment where care is needed. The modular frame, collapsible stand, and advanced fasteners combine to deliver unmatched stability and flexibility.

This is a tool designed for movement — empowering therapists to bring their work into homes, gyms, sports venues, and recovery centers. It reduces physical strain, preserves energy, and allows professionals to focus fully on the client, not the equipment. With optional color customization and branding, Sidekick Air becomes an extension of each practitioner’s identity — a reflection of their professionalism and passion.

Sidekick Air isn’t just a table; it’s an ally — built to move with the therapist, to grow with the industry, and to elevate the standard of care.

## **Section 4: A New Industry Standard**

Sidekick Air sets a new benchmark for therapeutic equipment. Using precision drop-stitch technology, it delivers the strength and stability of a solid table without the limitations of traditional design. It can be stored compactly, shipped efficiently, and set up anywhere care is needed — from clinics to stadiums, from homes to international travel.

Future models will feature built-in AI technology, connecting through a simple QR code to a personalized ‘Clinical AI Coach.’ This digital companion will assist practitioners with treatment planning, business analytics, and professional growth — creating a seamless connection between technology and hands-on care.

Sidekick Air is more than a new product. It’s the beginning of a new standard — one that redefines how care is delivered, how therapists thrive, and how the profession moves forward together.
